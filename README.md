# dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

## Modifying blocks

The status bar is made from text output from command-line programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the **config.h** header file.

## Mouse clicks

If you have the appropriate [patches](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/)
in your DWM build, you _blocks_ can handle mouse clicks. The code those patches
introduce in this project has been slightly modified from the original.
